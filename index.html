<p>In 1941, Japan bombed the United States naval base, Pearl Harbor. This caused America to declare war on Japan, and as an effect, Germany declared war on the United States. In 1942, the first US troops landed their first major amphibious attack on the Japanese, they seized a major air field, restricting supplies. Later on in the war, US soldiers landed on European soil with the major turning point of the war, D Day. The landings at Normandy declared a major turning point for the European theatre because it allowed the Allied forces to slowly regain power in France and push the Nazis back.</p>

<br>

<h2>OUTCOME</br>
<p>The end of the European Theatre came on May 7, 1945. The allied forces had closed in on Germany and by that point Adolf Hitler at already comited suicide. At the end of the war many concentration camps were freed, roughly 45 million people had died in the European theatre alone.
The end of the Pacific theatre came on August 6 and 9, 1945, when the United States dropped Little Boy and Fat Man on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This was the first use of nuclear weapons in war and they haven’t been used since. The bombs completely leveled the cities and cost roughly 210,000 people their lives.</p>
